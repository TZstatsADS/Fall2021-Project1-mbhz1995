## Project 1: A "data story" on the history of philosophy

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: What emotions do some well-known philosophers express in their masterpieces?
+ This project is conducted by Bohao Ma.

+ Project summary: When it comes to philosophy, we tend to focus on philosophers' thoughts and beliefs about some fundamental questions, such as those about value, mind, and existence. However, we rarely pay attention to the emotions expressed in some masterpieces of philosophy. In this report, therefore, I aim at answering the following question: what emotions do some well-known philosophers express in their masterpieces?

+ Three sub-questions answered by this report are:
    1. Overall, what types of emotion are expressed in philosophy texts?
    2. Are there any differences between philosopher in terms of expressing emotions in their texts?
    3. Do philosophers from different schools of philosophy tend to express different emotions in their masterpieces?
